      "description": "Many entities can be interacted with inside the jar and will continue to simulate while inside the jar. Some examples include: chickens will lay eggs, sheep can be sheared, cows can be milked, and some mobs like the Blaze will turn the jar into a light source. Experiment with a variety of mobs to create aesthetic and functional farms. Drygmys will also treat the jar as if it were a normal entity in the area."

      "description": "A jarred Allay can pickup and deposit items within 5 blocks of the jar. Giving an Allay an item will cause it to only pickup that item. Giving an Allay an Item Scroll will pickup any item that matches the scroll. Items will be deposited into inventories placed adjacent to the jar. Allays will also respect any filters placed on the adjacent inventories."
