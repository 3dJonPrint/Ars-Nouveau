      "description": "To obtain Source Gems, you must first build an Imbuement Chamber. An Imbuement Chamber imbues items inside it with Source, and will convert them to a new item. To obtain a source gem, place an Amethyst or Lapis inside your Imbuement Chamber and wait. Imbuement Chambers will consume source from nearby Source Jars to speed up any crafting. A Dowsing Rod can be used for finding Budding Amethyst early.",
