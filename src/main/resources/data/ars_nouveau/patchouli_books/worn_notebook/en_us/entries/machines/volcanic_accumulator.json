To generate mana, the accumulator requires Lava Source blocks beneath it in up to a 3x3 area around it. Each source block will generate additional mana.

This conversion is dependent on the amount of mana it has produced over time. The Volcanic Accumulator will also spawn a Lava Lily around it, given that there is nothing covering the lava. Lava Lilys may be harvested and used for decoration."
